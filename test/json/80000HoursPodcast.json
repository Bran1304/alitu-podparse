In the years following COVID-19, humanity may be inspired to better prepare for the existential risks of the next century: improving our science, updating our policy options, and enhancing our social cohesion. <br><br>\n\nCOVID-19 is a tragedy of stunning proportions, and its immediate threat is undoubtedly worthy of significant resources. <br><br>\n\nBut we will get through it; if a future biological catastrophe poses an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Precipice-Existential-Risk-Future-Humanity/dp/0316484911\"><i>existential</i> risk</a>, we may not get a second chance. It is therefore vital to learn every lesson we can from this pandemic, and provide our descendants with the security we wish for ourselves. <br><br>\n\nToday’s episode is the hosting debut of our Strategy Advisor, Howie Lempel. <br><br>\n\n80,000 Hours has focused on COVID-19 for the last few weeks and published <a href=\"https://80k.link/gl-c19\"><b>over ten</b></a> pieces about it, and a substantial benefit of this interview was to help inform our own views.

      "description": "Today's bonus episode of the podcast is a quick conversation between me and my fellow 80,000 Hours researcher Arden Koehler about a few topics, including the demandingness of morality, work-life balance, and emotional reactions to injustice. <br><br>\n\nArden is about to graduate with a philosophy PhD from New York University, so naturally we dive right into some challenging implications of utilitarian philosophy and how it might be applied to real life. Issues we talk about include: <br><br>\n\n• If you’re not going to be completely moral, should you try being a bit more ethical, or give up? <br>\n• Should you feel angry if you see an injustice, and if so, why? <br>\n• How much should we ask people to live frugally? <br><br>\n\nSo far the feedback on the post-episode chats that we've done have been positive, so we thought we'd go ahead and try out this freestanding one.

      "summary": "Today's bonus episode of the podcast is a quick conversation between me and my fellow 80,000 Hours researcher Arden Koehler about a few topics, including the demandingness of morality, work-life balance, and emotional reactions to injustice. Arden is about to graduate with a philosophy PhD from New York University, so naturally we dive right into some challenging implications of utilitarian philosophy and how it might be applied to real life. Issues we talk about include: • If you’re not going to be completely moral, should you try being a bit more ethical, or give up? • Should you feel angry if you see an injustice, and if so, why? • How much should we ask people to live frugally? So far the feedback on the post-episode chats that we've done have been positive, so we thought we'd go ahead and try out this freestanding one. But fair warning: it's among the more difficult episodes to follow, and probably not the best one to listen to first, as you'll benefit from having more context! If you'd like to listen to more of Arden you can find her in episode 67, David Chalmers on the nature and ethics of consciousness, or episode 66, Peter Singer on being provocative, EA, and how his moral views have changed. Here's more information on some of the issues we touch on: • Consequentialism on Wikipedia • Appropriate dispositions on the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy • Demandingness objection on Wikipedia • And a paper on epistemic normativity. ——— I mention the call for papers of the Academic Workshop on Global Priorities in the introduction — you can learn more here.

      "description": "You’re given a box with a set of dice in it. If you roll an even number, a person's life is saved. If you roll an odd number, someone else will die. Each time you shake the box you get $10. Should you do it? <br><br>\n\nA committed consequentialist might say, <em>\"Sure! Free money!\"</em> But most will think it obvious that you should say no. You've only gotten a tiny benefit, in exchange for moral responsibility over whether other people live or die. <br><br>\n\nAnd yet, according to today’s return guest, philosophy Prof Will MacAskill, in a real sense we’re shaking this box every time we leave the house, and those who think shaking the box is wrong should probably also be shutting themselves indoors and minimising their interactions with others. <br><br>\n\n• <a href=\"https://80k.link/will2\"><b>Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.</b></a><br>\n• <a href=\"https://80k.link/gpio\"><b>Job opportunities at the Global Priorities Institute.</b></a><br><br>\n\nTo see this, imagine you’re deciding whether to redeem a coupon for a free movie. If you go, you’ll need to drive to the cinema. By affecting traffic throughout the city, you’ll have slightly impacted the schedules of thousands or tens of thousands of people.

And yet, according to today’s return guest, philosophy Prof Will MacAskill, in a real sense we’re shaking this box every time we leave the house, and those who think shaking the box is wrong should probably also be shutting themselves indoors and minimising their interactions with others. • Links to learn more, summary and full transcript. • Job opportunities at the Global Priorities Institute.

There’s a lot going on in your head — your conscious experience. <br><br>\n\nNow imagine beings that are identical to humans, but for one thing: they lack this conscious experience. If you spill your coffee on them, they’ll jump like anyone else, but inside they'll feel no pain and have no thoughts: the lights are off. <br><br>\n\nThe concept of these so-called 'philosophical zombies' was popularised by today’s guest — celebrated philosophy professor David Chalmers — in order to explore the nature of consciousness. In a forthcoming book he poses a classic 'trolley problem': <br><br>\n\n\"Suppose you have a conscious human on one train track, and five non-conscious humanoid zombies on another. If you do nothing, a trolley will hit and kill the conscious human. If you flip a switch to redirect the trolley, you can save the conscious human, but in so doing kill the five non-conscious humanoid zombies. What should you do?\" <br><br>\n\nMany people think you should divert the trolley, precisely because the lack of conscious experience means the moral status of the zombies is much reduced or absent entirely. <br><br>\n\nSo, which features of consciousness qualify someone for moral consideration? One view is that the only conscious states that matter are those that have a positive or negative quality, like pleasure and suffering.

Should you divert the trolley to kill the five Vulcans in order to save the human? <br><br>\n\nDave firmly believes the answer is no, and if he's right, pleasure and suffering can’t be the only things required for moral status. The fact that Vulcans are conscious in other ways must matter in itself. <br><br>\n\nDave is one of the world's top experts on the philosophy of consciousness. He helped return the question <i>'what is consciousness?'</i> to the centre stage of philosophy with his 1996 book <i>'The Conscious Mind'</i>, which argued against then-dominant materialist theories of consciousness. <br><br>\n\nThis comprehensive interview, at over four hours long, outlines each contemporary theory of consciousness, what they have going for them, and their likely ethical implications.

      "description": "Have you ever been infuriated by a doctor's unwillingness to give you an honest, probabilistic estimate about what to expect?

The strange thing is they were both developed using the same general-purpose reinforcement learning algorithm.<br><br>\n\nHow is this possible and what does it show?<br><br>\n\nIn today's interview Jack Clark, Policy Director at OpenAI, explains that from a computational perspective using a hand and playing Dota 2 are remarkably similar problems.<br><br>\n\nA robot hand needs to hold an object, move its fingers, and rotate it to the desired position.

      "summary": "OpenAI’s Dactyl is an AI system that can manipulate objects with a human-like robot hand. OpenAI Five is an AI system that can defeat humans at the video game Dota 2. The strange thing is they were both developed using the same general-purpose reinforcement learning algorithm. How is this possible and what does it show? In today's interview Jack Clark, Policy Director at OpenAI, explains that from a computational perspective using a hand and playing Dota 2 are remarkably similar problems. A robot hand needs to hold an object, move its fingers, and rotate it to the desired position. In Dota 2 you control a team of several different people, moving them around a map to attack an enemy. Your hand has 20 or 30 different joints to move. The number of main actions in Dota 2 is 10 to 20, as you move your characters around a map. When you’re rotating an objecting in your hand, you sense its friction, but you don’t directly perceive the entire shape of the object. In Dota 2, you're unable to see the entire map and perceive what's there by moving around&nbsp;– metaphorically 'touching' the space.

Compressing different sensory inputs down to a fundamental computational problem which we know how to solve only requires the right general-purpose software. The creation of such increasingly 'broad-spectrum' learning algorithms like&nbsp;has been a key story of the last few years, and this development like have unpredictable consequences, heightening the huge challenges that already exist in AI policy. Today’s interview is a mega-AI-policy-quad episode; Jack is joined by his colleagues Amanda Askell and Miles Brundage, on the day they released their fascinating and controversial large general language model GPT-2. We discuss: • What are the most significant changes in the AI policy world over the last year or two? • What capabilities are likely to develop over the next five, 10, 15, 20 years? • How much should we focus on the next couple of years, versus the next couple of decades? • How should we approach possible malicious uses of AI? • What are some of the potential ways OpenAI could make things worse, and how can they be avoided? • Publication norms for AI research • Where do we stand in terms of arms races between countries or different AI labs? • The case for creating newsletters • Should the AI community have a closer relationship to the military? • Working at OpenAI vs. working in the US government • How valuable is Twitter in the AI policy world? Rob is then joined by two of his colleagues&nbsp;– Niel Bowerman &amp; Michelle Hutchinson&nbsp;– to quickly discuss: • The reaction to OpenAI's release of GPT-2 • Jack’s critique of our US AI policy article • How valuable are roles in government? • Where do you start if you want to write content for a specific audience?

Funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and given very little editorial direction, Vox's Future Perfect&nbsp;aspires to be more or less that.

But according to Kelsey Piper, staff writer for this new section of Vox's website focused on effective altruist themes, Future Perfect's&nbsp;goal is to run in the opposite direction and make room for more substantive coverage that's not tied to the news cycle.

      "description": "If an asteroid impact or nuclear winter blocked the sun for years, our inability to grow food would result in billions dying of starvation, right? According to Dr David Denkenberger, co-author of <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_Everyone_No_Matter_What\">Feeding Everyone No Matter What</a></em>: no.

He investigates into when to quit your job, when to marry, the best way to sell your house, how long to spend on a difficult decision, and how much randomness to inject into your life.

      "title": "#45 - Tyler Cowen's case for maximising econ growth, stabilising civilization & thinking long-term",
      "description": "I've probably spent more time reading Tyler Cowen - Professor of Economics at George Mason University - than any other author. Indeed it's his incredibly popular blog <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com\">Marginal Revolution</a> that prompted me to study economics in the first place. Having spent thousands of hours absorbing Tyler's work, it was a pleasure to be able to question him about his latest book and personal manifesto: <a href=\"https://press.stripe.com/#stubborn-attachments\"><em>Stubborn Attachments: A Vision for a Society of Free, Prosperous, and Responsible Individuals</em></a>.<br><br>\n\nTyler makes the case that, despite what you may have heard, we *can* make rational judgments about what is best for society as a whole. He argues:<br><br>\n\n1. Our top moral priority should be preserving and improving humanity's long-term future<br>\n2. The way to do that is to maximise the rate of sustainable economic growth<br>\n3. We should respect human rights and follow general principles while doing so.<br><br>\n\nWe discuss why Tyler believes all these things, and I push back where I disagree. In particular: is higher economic growth actually an effective way to safeguard humanity's future, or should our focus really be elsewhere?<br><br>\n\nIn the process we touch on many of moral philosophy's most pressing questions: Should we discount the future? How should we aggregate welfare across people? Should we follow rules or evaluate every situation individually? How should we deal with the massive uncertainty about the effects of our actions? And should we trust common sense morality or follow structured theories?<br><br>\n\n<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/tyler-cowen-stubborn-attachments/?utm_campaign=podcast__tyler-cowen&utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&utm_medium=podcast\"><b>Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.</b></a><br><br>\n\nAfter covering the book, the conversation ranges far and wide.

      "summary": "I've probably spent more time reading Tyler Cowen - Professor of Economics at George Mason University - than any other author. Indeed it's his incredibly popular blog Marginal Revolution that prompted me to study economics in the first place. Having spent thousands of hours absorbing Tyler's work, it was a pleasure to be able to question him about his latest book and personal manifesto: Stubborn Attachments: A Vision for a Society of Free, Prosperous, and Responsible Individuals. Tyler makes the case that, despite what you may have heard, we *can* make rational judgments about what is best for society as a whole. He argues: 1. Our top moral priority should be preserving and improving humanity's long-term future 2. The way to do that is to maximise the rate of sustainable economic growth 3. We should respect human rights and follow general principles while doing so. We discuss why Tyler believes all these things, and I push back where I disagree. In particular: is higher economic growth actually an effective way to safeguard humanity's future, or should our focus really be elsewhere? In the process we touch on many of moral philosophy's most pressing questions: Should we discount the future? How should we aggregate welfare across people? Should we follow rules or evaluate every situation individually? How should we deal with the massive uncertainty about the effects of our actions? And should we trust common sense morality or follow structured theories? Links to learn more, summary and full transcript. After covering the book, the conversation ranges far and wide. Will we leave the galaxy, and is it a tragedy if we don't? Is a multi-polar world less stable? Will humanity ever help wild animals? Why do we both agree that Kant and Rawls are overrated? Today's interview is released on both the 80,000 Hours Podcast and Tyler's own show: Conversation with Tyler. Tyler may have had more influence on me than any other writer but this conversation is richer for our remaining disagreements. If the above isn't enough to tempt you to listen, we also look at: * Why couldn’t future technology make human life a hundred or a thousand times better than it is for people today? * Why focus on increasing the rate of economic growth rather than making sure that it doesn’t go to zero? * Why shouldn’t we dedicate substantial time to the successful introduction of genetic engineering? * Why should we completely abstain from alcohol and make it a social norm? * Why is Tyler so pessimistic about space? Is it likely that humans will go extinct before we manage to escape the galaxy? * Is improving coordination and international cooperation a major priority? * Why does Tyler think institutions are keeping up with technology? * Given that our actions seem to have very large and morally significant effects in the long run, are our moral obligations very onerous? * Can art be intrinsically valuable? * What does Tyler think Derek Parfit was most wrong about, and what was he was most right about that’s unappreciated today?

This often happens because of confusion between preferences and moral positions. Assuming good faith on the part of the person you disagree with, and actually engaging with the beliefs they claim to hold, is perhaps the best remedy for our inability to make progress on controversial issues. One potential path for progress surrounds contraception; a lot of people who are anti-abortion are also anti-contraception. But they’ll usually think that abortion is much worse than contraception, so why can’t we compromise and agree to have much more contraception available? According to Amanda, a charitable explanation for this is that people who are anti-abortion and anti-contraception engage in moral reasoning and advocacy based on what, in their minds, is the best of all possible worlds: one where people neither use contraception nor get abortions. So instead of arguing about abortion and contraception, we could discuss the underlying principle that one should advocate for the best possible world, rather than the best probable world. Successfully break down such ethical beliefs, absent political toxicity, and it might be possible to actually converge on a key point of agreement. Today’s episode blends such everyday topics with in-depth philosophy, including: * What is 'moral cluelessness' and how can we work around it? * Amanda's biggest criticisms of social justice activists, and of critics of social justice activists * Is there an ethical difference between prison and corporal punishment? * How to resolve 'infinitarian paralysis' - the inability to make decisions when infinities are involved. * What’s effective altruism doing wrong? * How should we think about jargon?

      "summary": "With 698 inmates per 100,000 citizens, the U.S. is by far the leader among large wealthy nations in incarceration. But what effect does imprisonment actually have on crime? According to David Roodman, Senior Advisor to the Open Philanthropy Project, the marginal effect is zero. * 80,000 HOURS IMPACT SURVEY - Let me know how this show has helped you with your career. * ROB'S AUDIOBOOK RECOMMENDATIONS This stunning rebuke to the American criminal justice system comes from the man Holden Karnofsky’s called \"the gold standard for in-depth quantitative research\", whose other investigations include the risk of geomagnetic storms, whether deworming improves health and test scores, and the development impacts of microfinance. Links to learn more, summary and full transcript. The effects of crime can be split into three categories; before, during, and after. Does having tougher sentences deter people from committing crime? After reviewing studies on gun laws and ‘three strikes’ in California, David concluded that the effect of deterrence is zero. Does imprisoning more people reduce crime by incapacitating potential offenders? Here he says yes, noting that crimes like motor vehicle theft have gone up in a way that seems pretty clearly connected with recent Californian criminal justice reforms (though the effect on violent crime is far lower). Finally, do the after-effects of prison make you more or less likely to commit future crimes? This one is more complicated. Concerned that he was biased towards a comfortable position against incarceration, David did a cost-benefit analysis using both his favored reading of the evidence and the devil's advocate view; that there is deterrence and that the after-effects are beneficial. For the devil’s advocate position David used the highest assessment of the harm caused by crime, which suggests a year of prison prevents about $92,000 in crime. But weighed against a lost year of liberty, valued at $50,000, plus the cost of operating prisons, the numbers came out exactly the same. So even using the least-favorable cost-benefit valuation of the least favorable reading of the evidence -- it just breaks even. The argument for incarceration melts further when you consider the significant crime that occurs within prisons, de-emphasised because of a lack of data and a perceived lack of compassion for inmates. In today’s episode we discuss how to conduct such impactful research, and how to proceed having reached strong conclusions. We also cover: * How do you become a world class researcher? What kinds of character traits are important? * Are academics aware of following perverse incentives? * What’s involved in data replication? How often do papers replicate? * The politics of large orgs vs. small orgs * Geomagnetic storms as a potential cause area * How much does David rely on interviews with experts? * The effects of deworming on child health and test scores * Should we have more ‘data vigilantes’? * What are David’s critiques of effective altruism? * What are the pros and cons of starting your career in the think tank world?

      "title": "#38 - Prof Ng on anticipating effective altruism decades ago & how to make a much happier world",
      "description": "Will people who think carefully about how to maximize welfare eventually converge on the same views?<br><br>\n\nThe effective altruism community has spent a lot of time over the past 10 years debating how best to increase happiness and reduce suffering, and gradually narrowed in on the world’s poorest people, all animals capable of suffering, and future generations.<br><br>\n\nYew-Kwang Ng, Professor of Economics at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore,  was independently working on this exact question since the 70s. Many of his conclusions have ended up foreshadowing what is now conventional wisdom within effective altruism - though other views he holds remain controversial or little-known.<br><br>\n\nFor instance, he thinks we ought to explore increasing pleasure via direct brain stimulation, and that genetic engineering may be an important tool for increasing happiness in the future.<br><br>\n\nHis work has suggested that the welfare of most wild animals is on balance negative and he thinks that in the future this is a problem humanity might work to solve. Yet he thinks that greatly improved conditions for farm animals could eventually justify eating meat.<br><br>\n\nHe has spent most of his life advocating for the view that happiness, broadly construed, is the only intrinsically valuable thing.<br><br>\n\nIf it’s true that careful researchers will converge as Prof Ng believes, these ideas may prove as prescient as his other, now widely accepted, opinions.<br><br>\n\n<a href=\"https://80k.link/kwang-articles\"><b>Link to our summary and appreciation of Kwang’s top publications and insights throughout a lifetime of research.</b></a><br><br>\n\nKwang has led an exceptional life.

      "summary": "Will people who think carefully about how to maximize welfare eventually converge on the same views? The effective altruism community has spent a lot of time over the past 10 years debating how best to increase happiness and reduce suffering, and gradually narrowed in on the world’s poorest people, all animals capable of suffering, and future generations. Yew-Kwang Ng, Professor of Economics at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, was independently working on this exact question since the 70s. Many of his conclusions have ended up foreshadowing what is now conventional wisdom within effective altruism - though other views he holds remain controversial or little-known. For instance, he thinks we ought to explore increasing pleasure via direct brain stimulation, and that genetic engineering may be an important tool for increasing happiness in the future. His work has suggested that the welfare of most wild animals is on balance negative and he thinks that in the future this is a problem humanity might work to solve. Yet he thinks that greatly improved conditions for farm animals could eventually justify eating meat. He has spent most of his life advocating for the view that happiness, broadly construed, is the only intrinsically valuable thing. If it’s true that careful researchers will converge as Prof Ng believes, these ideas may prove as prescient as his other, now widely accepted, opinions. Link to our summary and appreciation of Kwang’s top publications and insights throughout a lifetime of research. Kwang has led an exceptional life. While in high school he was drawn to physics, mathematics, and philosophy, yet he chose to study economics because of his dream: to establish communism in an independent Malaya. But events in the Soviet Union and China, in addition to his burgeoning knowledge and academic appreciation of economics, would change his views about the practicability of communism. He would soon complete his journey from young revolutionary to academic economist, and eventually become a columnist writing in support of Deng Xiaoping’s Chinese economic reforms in the 80s. He got his PhD at Sydney University in 1971, and has since published over 250 refereed papers - covering economics, biology, politics, mathematics, philosophy, psychology, and sociology. He's most well-known for his work in welfare economics, and proposed ‘welfare biology’ as a new field of study. In 2007, he was made a Distinguished Fellow of the Economic Society of Australia, the highest award that the society bestows. Links to learn more, summary and full transcript. In this episode we discuss how he developed some of his most unusual ideas and his fascinating life story, including: * Why Kwang believes that *’Happiness Is Absolute, Universal, Ultimate, Unidimensional, Cardinally Measurable and Interpersonally Comparable’* * What are the most pressing questions in economics? * Did Kwang have to worry about censorship from the Chinese government when promoting market economics, or concern for animal welfare? * Welfare economics and where Kwang thinks it went wrong Get this episode by subscribing to our podcast on the world’s most pressing problems and how to solve them: search for '80,000 Hours' in your podcasting app. The 80,000 Hours Podcast is produced by Keiran Harris.",

And yet, of the 800,000 people who kill themselves globally each year 20% die from pesticide self-poisoning. Full transcript, summary and links to articles discussed in today's show. Research suggests most people who try to kill themselves with pesticides reflect on the decision for less than 30 minutes, and that less than 10% of those who don't die the first time around will try again.

We start by describing his key findings, and then push to the edge of what is known about how to foresee the unforeseeable: * Should people who want to be right just adopt the views of experts rather than apply their own judgement? * Why are Berkeley undergrads worse forecasters than dart-throwing chimps? * Should I keep my political views secret, so it will be easier to change them later? * How can listeners contribute to his latest cutting-edge research? * What do we know about our accuracy at predicting low-probability high-impact disasters? * Does his research provide an intellectual basis for populist political movements? * Was the Iraq War caused by bad politics, or bad intelligence methods? * What can we learn about forecasting from the 2016 election? * Can experience help people avoid overconfidence and underconfidence? * When does an AI easily beat human judgement? * Could more accurate forecasting methods make the world more dangerous? * How much does demographic diversity line up with cognitive diversity? * What are the odds we’ll go to war with China? * Should we let prediction tournaments run most of the government?

      "description": "Of all the people whose well-being we should care about, only a small fraction are alive today. The rest are members of future generations who are yet to exist.

      "summary": "Just two years ago OpenAI didn’t exist. It’s now among the most elite groups of machine learning researchers. They’re trying to make an AI that’s smarter than humans and have $1b at their disposal. Even stranger for a Silicon Valley start-up, it’s not a business, but rather a non-profit founded by Elon Musk and Sam Altman among others, to ensure the benefits of AI are distributed broadly to all of society. I did a long interview with one of its first machine learning researchers, Dr Dario Amodei, to learn about: * OpenAI’s latest plans and research progress. * His paper *Concrete Problems in AI Safety*, which outlines five specific ways machine learning algorithms can act in dangerous ways their designers don’t intend - something OpenAI has to work to avoid. * How listeners can best go about pursuing a career in machine learning and AI development themselves. Full transcript, apply for personalised coaching to work on AI safety, see what questions are asked when, and read extra resources to learn more. 1m33s - What OpenAI is doing, Dario’s research and why AI is important 13m - Why OpenAI scaled back its Universe project 15m50s - Why AI could be dangerous 24m20s - Would smarter than human AI solve most of the world’s problems? 29m - Paper on five concrete problems in AI safety 43m48s - Has OpenAI made progress? 49m30s - What this back flipping noodle can teach you about AI safety 55m30s - How someone can pursue a career in AI safety and get a job at OpenAI 1h02m30s - Where and what should people study? 1h4m15s - What other paradigms for AI are there? 1h7m55s - How do you go from studying to getting a job? What places are there to work? 1h13m30s - If there's a 17-year-old listening here what should they start reading first? 1h19m - Is this a good way to develop your broader career options? Is it a safe move? 1h21m10s - What if you’re older and haven’t studied machine learning? How do you break in? 1h24m - What about doing this work in academia? 1h26m50s - Is the work frustrating because solutions may not exist? 1h31m35s - How do we prevent a dangerous arms race? 1h36m30s - Final remarks on how to get into doing useful work in machine learning",
