I roared through the book. And then, impressed with what I read, I asked Craig to come on the show to talk about his passion. And, it is a passion. Craig figures he has five thousand tomato varieties in his collection, and that he's personally grown out more than 2000 of them. This episode: part one of our conversation, which focuses on heirloom history, and practical considerations for starting tomatoes in the nursery and pruning them in the field.

Rochelle has been an organic inspector, AKA organic verification officer, for years, and she's been involved in various levels of the oraganic farming certification bureaucracy throughout that time. Rochelle joined me to explain how the organic bureacratic machine works. Sounds boring, I know, but I think you'll really enjoy this if you've ever wondered how organic standards are formed or changed, or how you can influence them. If you're currently an organic farmer, or think you might be in future, or like to spout off about how the system is corrupt, or how the system is too expensive or too onerous, you should give this a listen. The topic may be a little bland, but Rochelle is the hotsauce that makes it enjoyable. A note to my american listeners that Rochelle and I focus on the Canadian organic system which she tells me is quite different than yours. I still think you'll find value here though. It may just make you want to go and learn more about the American system.</p>",

Natalie, who completed a farm apprenticeship a few summers back and now works on a farm in Quebec, is my guest for this episode, along with Robin Johnston and Bernard Soubrey, two young farmers based in Atlantic Canada who also went through the apprenticeship system and share Natalie's concerns about underpaid farm labour on some small-scale farms. </p>\n<p>This is the last episode of 2015; I'll be back with a new episode in early January.</p>\n<p> </p>",

Delaney bought a <a href= \"http://www.harperturfequipment.com/blowers/top-feed-straw-blower/\"> tractor attachment</a> that chops and spreads straw onto his beds and/or pathways. The resulting mulch is good for weed suppression, moisture retention, and. ultimately, for adding organic matter to the soil. </p> <p>Conversation two is with Andrea Gunner of <a href= \"http://rosebankfarms.ca\">Rosebank Farms</a>. Government-imposed production limits made it hard for Andrea to exploit economies of scale in her pastured poultry operation. More independant producers in her region could potentially team up to exploit economies of scale together through cooperation, so Andrea began mentoring new farmers near her farm and then cooperating with them on bulk feed purchases and slaughter.</p>",

To finance part of their farm's growth, Sean and his wife Geneviève asked friends and family to invest in their vision by selling 'bonds' that paid a small rate of return on investment. They call it 'Community Financed Farming'. Sound familiar? The couple took some inspiration from Paul Slomp of Grazing Days Farm, who talked about his own success with this model on <a href=\"https://theruminant.squarespace.com/the-podcast/2013/10/30/the-ruminant-podcast-episode-20-paul-slomp-grazing-days-farm-and-funding-your-farm-start-up-by-selling-bonds\">episode 20</a> of the podcast. </p>\n<p>Also: I asked for some good ideas that you implemented on your farms this past season, and, well, one of you responded. Dan Brisebois of <a href=\"https://www.fermetournesol.qc.ca/en/\">Ferme Tourne-Sol</a> tells us about all the labour he saved this year by mulching his garden pathways with landscape fabric, and how you can do it, too. </p>",

I've added a new intro, as well as a brand new segment at the end of the episode.</p>\n<p>In this long-form interview with gardening writer Steve Solomon, we discuss his new book, The Intelligent Gardener, which he co-wrote with Erica Reinheimer.</p>\n<p>In it, Steve argues that the key to growing healthy crops is to combine the return of organic matter to the soil with a practice called remineralization, which involves assessing the mineral content of your soil and then adding the right mix of amendments to ensure they are in proper balance (Steve's contention: few soils are). Along the way, Steve provides an excellent beginner's entry into soil science, and challenges some of the organic movement's tightly held assumptions about sustainable crop production.</p>\n<p>This is part 2 of our conversation. In this segment we focus on the assertions Steve makes in his book regarding healthy vegetables, how to achieve a nutrient-balanced soil, and why organic gardeners should be open to the idea of using certain synthetic fertilizers.</p>",

Why? In this interview, Monica explains why modern, commercial wheat varieties kind of suck if you're interested in nutrition and taste, and why a rediscovery of older varieties of wheat could be so good for food security.</p>\n<p>Monica also provides some advice on getting started with producing wheat and other grains on your farm or in the garden. She says it's easy to do, and no space is too small. </p>\n<p>Monica also co-authored a book on this subject, with her husband Gene. It's called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Fiber-Better-High-fiber-Plant-based/dp/159120111X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1428552582&sr=8-1&keywords=what%27s+with+fiber\">What's With Fiber?</a></p>\n<p>I was inspired to contact Monica after reading this article about her at a cool site called <a href=\"http://luckypeach.com/profile-in-obsession-monica-spiller/\">Lucky Peach.</a></p>\n<p> </p>",

Rome runs a website called <a href=\"http://backyardbeansandgrains.com\">Backyard Beans and Grains</a>, and has published a great manual on selecting, growing, processing and storing various legumes and grains, with a focus on small-scale production. </p>\n<p>From her website: <em>The Backyard Beans and Grains Project (BBGP) was started in 2008 as a response to the challenge of incorporating locally-grown staple foods into the diet. Whatcom County (and Western Washington in general) produces a large variety of vegetables, berries, dairy products, and to a lesser degree, fruits, fish and meat. The missing element, especially for vegetarians, those on low income, or those with dairy allergies, is a variety of storable, high-quality vegetable protein sources, i.e. dry legumes and grains.</em></p>\n<p><em>Our research is conducted for the benefit of all regional farmers and gardeners who wish to grow dry beans and grains. We record detailed information about varieties, plant spacing, dates, labor inputs, yields, harvesting and threshing techniques, seed-saving, and storage.  </em></p>\n<p><em>We have self-published an instruction manual, entitled \"Growing Dry Beans & Grains in the Pacific Northwest\", which contains information on growing, harvesting, and processing dry legumes and grains tailored specifically for Pacific Northwest growers.</em></p>\n<p>In this episode, Krista takes me through the ins and outs of growing legumes and grains on a super small scale.</p>",
