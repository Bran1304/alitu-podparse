I roared through the book. And then, impressed with what I read, I asked Craig to come on the show to talk about his passion. And, it is a passion. Craig figures he has five thousand tomato varieties in his collection, and that he's personally grown out more than 2000 of them. This episode: part one of our conversation, which focuses on heirloom history, and practical considerations for starting tomatoes in the nursery and pruning them in the field.

Rochelle joined me to explain how the organic bureacratic machine works. Sounds boring, I know, but I think you'll really enjoy this if you've ever wondered how organic standards are formed or changed, or how you can influence them. If you're currently an organic farmer, or think you might be in future, or like to spout off about how the system is corrupt, or how the system is too expensive or too onerous, you should give this a listen. The topic may be a little bland, but Rochelle is the hotsauce that makes it enjoyable. A note to my american listeners that Rochelle and I focus on the Canadian organic system which she tells me is quite different than yours. I still think you'll find value here though. It may just make you want to go and learn more about the American system.</p>",

Delaney bought a <a href= \"http://www.harperturfequipment.com/blowers/top-feed-straw-blower/\"> tractor attachment</a> that chops and spreads straw onto his beds and/or pathways. The resulting mulch is good for weed suppression, moisture retention, and. ultimately, for adding organic matter to the soil. </p> <p>Conversation two is with Andrea Gunner of <a href= \"http://rosebankfarms.ca\">Rosebank Farms</a>. Government-imposed production limits made it hard for Andrea to exploit economies of scale in her pastured poultry operation.

Along the way, Steve provides an excellent beginner's entry into soil science, and challenges some of the organic movement's tightly held assumptions about sustainable crop production.</p>\n<p>This is part 2 of our conversation.

      "description": "<p>Monica Spiller has devoted much of her life to promoting the health benefits of a whole grain diet, with a specific focus on whole grain wheat bread. </p>\n<p>In 2000, she founded a non-profit organization called <a href=\"http://www.sustainablegrains.org/index.html\">The Whole Grain Connection</a>, which aims to help farmers and gardeners access, test and grow heirloom varieties of wheat. Why? In this interview, Monica explains why modern, commercial wheat varieties kind of suck if you're interested in nutrition and taste, and why a rediscovery of older varieties of wheat could be so good for food security.</p>\n<p>Monica also provides some advice on getting started with producing wheat and other grains on your farm or in the garden. She says it's easy to do, and no space is too small. </p>\n<p>Monica also co-authored a book on this subject, with her husband Gene. It's called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Fiber-Better-High-fiber-Plant-based/dp/159120111X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1428552582&sr=8-1&keywords=what%27s+with+fiber\">What's With Fiber?</a></p>\n<p>I was inspired to contact Monica after reading this article about her at a cool site called <a href=\"http://luckypeach.com/profile-in-obsession-monica-spiller/\">Lucky Peach.</a></p>\n<p> </p>",

Herein, we discuss some of the barriers to achieving a more integrated food and wine culture, and why such an outcome would be better for that culture, and even for food security.</p> <p>Rhys and his partner Alishan Driediger make wines that can be found on their website, <a href= \"http://littlefarmwinery.ca\">littlefarmwinery.ca</a>. He also has a project called <a href=\"http://wineplus.ca\">Wine Plus+</a>.</p>",

We record detailed information about varieties, plant spacing, dates, labor inputs, yields, harvesting and threshing techniques, seed-saving, and storage.  </em></p>\n<p><em>We have self-published an instruction manual, entitled \"Growing Dry Beans & Grains in the Pacific Northwest\", which contains information on growing, harvesting, and processing dry legumes and grains tailored specifically for Pacific Northwest growers.</em></p>\n<p>In this episode, Krista takes me through the ins and outs of growing legumes and grains on a super small scale.</p>",
